This is the homepage of the AlphaVantage package. This is a simple package that I created to help facilitate obtaining historical price and technical indicator data for any particular company or set of companies using the AlphaVantage API. The AlphaVantage API currently requires a user to access their data via json requests and the response the user gets after converting the json object to a dictionary can be intimidating to a beginner programmer. Even after converting the json response to a dictionary and then to a pandas dataframe, the dataframe comes transposed which is untraditional for most. For example, if a user queries the price for IBM stock and converts the response to a pandas dataframe it will have the daily close amount, daily open, daily high, low, etc. as the row indexes and the columns will be the prices for each day. This package facilitates this entire process using the same input arguments as AlphaVantage does. The user simply inputs the same arguments into the get_time_series_data or get_technical_indicator functions and gets a tidy pandas dataframe as a response. 

I am currently using this package and will fix any bugs that are found in the future, if any, and I will be adding descriptive statistic measures down the road such as n-day moving standard deviation, correlation, variance, sharpe ratio, etc. I hope you enjoy!
